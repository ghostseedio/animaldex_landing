# Ark scenery interface (for the map, behaviour, props and liveliness lanes)

The graphics pass owns the terrain and scenery (branch `ark-graphics`). Other lanes place things on it only through `src/ark-scene/sampler.ts`. The signatures below stay stable; what is underneath (heights, trees, the house) changes with each batch.

## Surface

`surfaceAt(x, z, environment?) → {height, normal, surface, weights, wetness, waterDepth, zone, cliff}`

- `surface` and `weights` use the ground shader's own layers: `grass, forest_floor, soil, sand, wet_sand, rock, mud, snow, tilled, seabed, lakebed`.
- `wetness` (0–1) covers the waterline, mud and banks, plus the weather's wetness. Footprints and sheen read it.
- `waterDepth` is measured at the given sea level, so the tide is included.
- `groundNormal(x, z)` and `shoreRadius(theta)` are helpers.

## Named places

`place(name) → {x, y, z, radius}`. Available names: `island_middle, beach, shore_rocks, tide_pools, visitor_landing, forest_floor, rainforest, woodland, house, house_porch_light, garden_pond, fields, lake, river_source, river_mouth, wetland, grassland, desert, mountain, mountain_peak, cold_cove, reef, open_ocean`.

The map build keeps these names and moves their positions. Golden shots and spawn rules use names, never coordinates.

## Attach points

`attachPoints({tag?, spot?, near?, size?, zone?}) → AttachPoint[]`; `allAttachPoints()` returns all of them.

Each point has:
- `id`: stable, `<tag>:<host>:<n>`;
- `tag`;
- `spot`: the microhabitats.json / layers.json tag;
- `position`;
- `normal`: the animal's up;
- `yaw`: its heading round the normal;
- `size`: [min, max] body length in metres;
- `zone`;
- `host`: what the point sits on.

Points are seeded, so every viewer gets the same ones.

| tag | spot | where |
|---|---|---|
| `leaf`, `branch` | canopy | round every tree's crown (the decor trees and the forest fill) |
| `bark` | bark | trunks, facing out |
| `canopy_perch`, `canopy_hang`, `canopy_climb` | canopy | the canopy trees' limbs (on top, under) and trunk |
| `flower_head` | flowers | the top of each flower |
| `rock_face` | rocks | round every rock |
| `tide_pool` | rocks | at the foot of the shore's low rocks |
| `house_wall`, `house_eave` | house | the cottage's four walls and its eaves |
| `porch_light`, `lamp` | lamp | the porch light and each zone's lamp post |
| `pond_surface` | pond_surface | the garden pond and the lake's margin |
| `leaf_litter` | leaf_litter | the forest floor |
| `worm_hole`, `burrow` | burrow | soft open ground, and banks |

**Rocks (batch 5):** every decor rock is drawn as one of the asset lane's rocks (`rock-assets.ts` `rockAssetFor(item)`: same place, turn and footprint; tide-pool rocks and barnacled clusters on the shore, mossy boulders in the woods and by the water, boulders and clusters elsewhere). A rock's `rock_face` points keep their ids (`rock_face:decor<i>:<k>`, four per rock) and now sit on the asset's own faces and ledges (`rockAttachPoints(placement)`, from the asset's attach.json, measured on the drawn lod0 surface), choosing faces that look outward. The assets also carry `ledge`, `crevice`, `burrow_entrance` and `tide_pool` points: `rockAttachPoints` returns them all, for any lane that wants them. When `ark-graphics-attach` is merged, its `drawnRockPoint` (the procedural rock's triangles) applies only where `rockAssetFor` returns null (the rock set missing).

**Coming next:** up close, the leaf, flower head, bark patch or rock face round the camera is swapped for a detailed near version that an animal can sit on. The asset lane's models will bring their own tagged points, merged into the same list.

## Weather and tide

The scene follows the shared island clock (`src/lib/ark-clock.ts`):
- the hour is `islandHours(Date.now(), 0)`, the same for every viewer;
- sea level comes from `seaLevelAt`;
- wetness, snow, wind and storm come from `weatherAt`.

`handle.setEnvironment({seaLevel, wetness, snow, wind, storm, windDirection})` pins any of these, and `null` follows the clock again. `handle.setHours(h)` pins the hour. Golden shots pin both.

The shaders read `ARK_ENV` (`glsl.ts`):
- the water reads sea level and roughness;
- the ground reads wetness and the snow line;
- the foliage reads the wind's strength through `ARK_WIND`.

## Under the sea (graphics batch 4, branch `ark-graphics-reef`)

Pure and deterministic, like the rest of this file: no three.js, no DOM, the same answer for every viewer.

### Reef growth (`src/ark-scene/reef.ts`)

- `reefGrowth() → ReefItem[]`: every coral, sponge, anemone, kelp plant and seagrass clump, with `kind`, `variant`, position (`y` is the bed), `scale`, `rotation`, `depth` (water over it at mean tide) and `substrate` (`reef | rock | rubble | sand`).
- `seaBedAt(x, z) → {depth, height, slope, substrate, reef, framework, shore, inland, cliff}`: what the sea bed is made of there.
- `reefLandmarks() → {anemones, cleaning, heads}`: the anemone patch and the cleaning station (the map lane's `anemone` and `cleaner_station` anchors, same positions), and the biggest coral heads with the height of their crowns (`top`).
- `REEF_HEIGHT[kind]`: each kind's height at scale 1, so a lane that puts an animal on a coral head can find its crown.

Placement rules: nothing stony shallower than 1.9 m (`CORAL_MIN_DEPTH`) or nearer than 0.9 m to the mean surface; corals on the reef's hard ground (patch reefs and rocky slopes) by depth band; seagrass on sand at 1.2–3.5 m (the lagoon, and patchy meadows off the beach); kelp on rock off the cliff coasts at 2.2–9 m. The map lane's tags (`coral_reef`, `seagrass`, `kelp`) use the same rules.

### Ambient fish schools (`src/ark-scene/fish-schools.ts`)

Decoration only, NOT catalogue animals: never counted, never selectable, never in the stats or the snapshot. Every fish's place is a closed-form function of the shared clock (epoch seconds) and its school's id: no simulation state, no per-viewer randomness.

- `fishSchoolsNear(pos, radius, epochSeconds?) → FishSchoolNow[]`: the schools whose middle is within `radius` of `pos` (y ignored if not given), nearest first. Each has:
  - `id` (stable, `fish:<habitat>:<n>`), `kind` (the look), `habitat` (`reef | reef_edge | open_water | kelp | shallows`), `style` (`school | roam | hover`);
  - `centre` {x, y, z}, `radius` (m), `heading` (unit, horizontal), `speed` (m/s), `count`;
  - `mode`: `"mill"` while it is balled up (a bait ball: what a predator chases), `"cruise"` streaming along, `"hover"` over its coral head; `milling` 0…1 as it eases in and out.
- `fishSchools()`: the static list (homes, ranges, sizes); `fishSchoolAt(school, epochSeconds?)`: one school now.
- `schoolFish(school, epochSeconds?) → Vec3[]`: every fish's position (for a predator picking one to lunge at).
- `seaEpochSeconds()`: the sea's clock (epoch seconds; golden shots pin it with `pinSeaClock`). Pass your own epoch to ask about any moment: the same epoch always gives the same answer.

Bait schools mill on seeded 50 s slots of the clock (about a third of the time for the reef-edge and open-water schools). Behaviour lanes that want a predator to chase a bait ball, or a bird or seal to fish, read `fishSchoolsNear` and steer their animal to `centre`; the fish themselves do not react (nothing is caught, nothing changes in the ecology).
